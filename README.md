# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The School Board found evidence in a csv file of academic dishonesty. The math and reading grades for the Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. It is currently unknown to what extent but the board wants to uphold state-testing standards. The School Board has asked to replace the math and reading scores with NaNs while maintaining the rest of the data intact. After replacing the math and reading scores, Maria would like a new school district analysis done to show how the overall analysis has been affected.
